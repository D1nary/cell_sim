# Project Version: dose1

The dose1 version encompasses a comprehensive simulation of tumor initiation, subsequent growth dynamics, and irradiation response. The specific features implemented are as follows:

- **Tumor Initialization**: Generation of a foundational tumor model.
- **Tumor Growth Dynamics**: Simulation of the tumor's proliferative behavior over a defined temporal period.
- **Irradiation and Post-Treatment Evolution**: Application of radiation therapy followed by monitoring of tumor progression over a 24-hour period.

In this version, data and visual outputs are categorized and stored separately for distinct phases:

- **growth**: Data acquired during the tumor growth phase, capturing the proliferation dynamics of the base tumor.
- **treatment**: Data and visual representations obtained immediately following irradiation and after a subsequent 24-hour period.

**Note**: The implementation of the "sum" data and plot, which provides a comprehensive overview of the total cell population, is yet to be completed.
