# Simulation Code Directories Structure

This directory contains the main code folders for the simulation:

- `src`: Source files for the simulation.

- `graph_codes`: Scripts used for generating plots and visualizations.

- `tested`: Contains test files for various simulation features.

- `results`: Stores simulation results. This includes folders for saving text files from both the growth and treatment phases, as well as directories for saving plots. For detailed information on how data is saved, refer to the file [grid_contr.md](../notes/grid_contr.md).
