# README

The simulation aims to reproduce the dynamics of a three-dimensional cellular environment and to model the impact of ionizing radiation, as occurs in External Beam Radiotherapy (EBR).

This repository contains the following folders:

- **cpp**: Contains the simulation source files, test scripts, and plotting tools. The simulation output data will be saved in the `results` folder within this directory.

- **notes**: Contains notes and documentation related to the simulation.

## Acknowledgements

This project is an attempt to extend the 2D cellular model proposed by [Grégoire Moreau](https://github.com/gregoire-moreau) into a 3D version, originally developed in the repository [radio\_rl](https://github.com/gregoire-moreau/radio_rl.git).

Many thanks to the original author for the excellent work!

## Third-party Code

Parts of this project are based on source files (`cell.cpp`, `grid.cpp`, and `controller.cpp`) from [radio_rl](https://github.com/gregoire-moreau/radio_rl) by [Grégoire Moreau](https://github.com/gregoire-moreau).  
Permission to adapt and reuse the code was obtained directly from the author, as the original repository does not specify a license.
