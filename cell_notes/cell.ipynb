    "## *cycle* funcion\n",
    "Here there is the analysis of the functions *cyle* inside the classes *HealthyCell*, *CancerCell* and *OARCell* \n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Steps and Differences of the `cycle` Functions in the `HealthyCell`, `CancerCell`, and `OARCell` Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Checking Critical Levels of Glucose and Oxygen**:\n",
    "    - If the glucose level is below the `critical_glucose_level` or the oxygen level is below the `critical_oxygen_level`, the cell dies.\n",
    "    - The cell count specific to each class is decremented.\n",
    "        - `HealthyCell`: `HealthyCell.cell_count -= 1`\n",
    "        - `CancerCell`: `CancerCell.cell_count -= 1`\n",
    "        - `OARCell`: `OARCell.cell_count -= 1`\n",
    "    - The function returns `(0, 0)` (for `OARCell`, the function may return `(0, 0, 2)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Aging of the Cell or Reduction of Repair Time**:\n",
    "    - If the cell is not in the repair phase (`self.repair == 0`), the cell's age (`self.age`) increases by one.\n",
    "    - If the cell is in the repair phase (`self.repair != 0`), the repair time (`self.repair`) decreases by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quiescent Stage (Stage 4)**:\n",
    "    - If the cell is in the quiescent stage:\n",
    "      - Check if the glucose is above the `quiescent_glucose_level`, the neighbor count is below `critical_neighbors`, and the oxygen is above the `quiescent_oxygen_level`.\n",
    "      - If all these conditions are met, the cell moves to stage 0 and its age is reset to 0.\n",
    "      - The function returns the efficiency reduced by 25% for both glucose absorption and oxygen consumption.\n",
    "      - **Difference in `CancerCell` there is no stage 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mitosis Stage (Stage 3)**:\n",
    "    - If the cell is in the mitosis stage and if the age is 1:\n",
    "      - It moves to stage 0 and its age is reset to 0.\n",
    "      - The function returns the full efficiency for both glucose absorption and oxygen consumption.\n",
    "      - **Difference in `HealthyCell`**: The function returns `(self.efficiency, self.oxy_efficiency, 0)`.\n",
    "      - **Difference in `CancerCell`**: The function returns `(self.efficiency, self.oxy_efficiency, 1)`.\n",
    "      - **Difference in `OARCell`**: The function returns `(self.efficiency, self.oxy_efficiency, 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Gap 2 Stage (Stage 2)**:\n",
    "    - If the cell is in the Gap 2 stage:\n",
    "      - Check if the cell's age is 4. If so, it moves to stage 3 and its age is reset to 0.\n",
    "      - The function returns the full efficiency for both glucose absorption and oxygen consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Synthesis Stage (Stage 1)**:\n",
    "    - If the cell is in the synthesis stage:\n",
    "      - Check if the cell's age is 8. If so, it moves to stage 2 and its age is reset to 0.\n",
    "      - The function returns the full efficiency for both glucose absorption and oxygen consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Gap 1 Stage (Stage 0)**:\n",
    "    - If the cell is in the Gap 1 stage:\n",
    "      - Check if the glucose is below the `quiescent_glucose_level`, the neighbor count is above `critical_neighbors`, or the oxygen is below the `quiescent_oxygen_level`. If so, the cell moves to stage 4 and its age is reset to 0.\n",
    "      - If the cell's age is 11, it moves to stage 1 and its age is reset to 0.\n",
    "      - The function returns the full efficiency for both glucose absorption and oxygen consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**:\n",
    "    - `HealthyCell`:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      self.efficiency = average_glucose_absorption * factor\n",
    "      self.oxy_efficiency = average_oxygen_consumption * factor\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - `CancerCell`:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      self.efficiency = average_cancer_glucose_absorption * factor\n",
    "      self.oxy_efficiency = average_oxygen_consumption * factor\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - `OARCell`:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      self.efficiency = average_glucose_absorption * factor\n",
    "      self.oxy_efficiency = average_oxygen_consumption * factor\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "---\n",
    "**NOTE**:\n",
    "The reason why HealthyCell, CancerCell and OARCell return different values ​​(0, 1, 3 respectively) when in the mitosis stage is due to the need to differentiate cell types and tailor the simulation responses based on the biological context and to treatment priorities. For example: cancer cells (1) may be more sensitive to radiotherapy during mitosis than healthy cells (0). The same should be for the other cell's phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to note is that cancer cells do not enter the quiescent phase because they lack the regulatory mechanisms that stop proliferation in response to unfavorable conditions.\n"
